# OmiseGo ReactJS Test Task

Create a front-end application allowing a user to paste a JSON formatted in a specific way (see Input) and display the cleaned version (see Ouput).

# Step 1

The first step focuses only on the front-end side. 

- Create a JavaScript application using React (and any other library/tool you want/need).
- The application must have an editable field where the user can paste a formatted JSON (Input).
- The application must show a non-editable field displaying the updated JSON (Output).
- The application must have automated tests.
- [Here's an example of the UI](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1b0SsgeUbwz9ybm-QckENtjKqATk8PJocPAlMoUGlYaY/edit?usp=sharing) (feel free to ignore it and do your own if you can do something better, this is just to give you a better idea of what's expected).
- (Bonus) Show off your CSS skills by making it look good.

# Step 2

This second step focuses on communication with an external API.

- Use the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#list-all-public-repositories) to list all public repositories.
- Show 10 repositories in a table with all the information that you judge necessary.
- Add pagination to allow the user to navigate the repositories, 10 per page.

# Guidelines

- Write clean, readable and well-structured code.
- Version-control with Git and write good commit messages.
- Write concise and well-targeted tests.
